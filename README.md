# ng7-phaser3-boilerplate
Create an Angular 7 + Phaser 3 application with this boilerplate as your base

## How to use
Clone the repository and use `npm install` to install all dependencies.
The script also downloads the typedefinitions from [phaser3-docs](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-docs) and puts them in the phaser node_module folder. 

`ng serve` and go to `http://localhost:4200` to try it out.

Whenever the Phaser 3 node module updates, be sure to run `npm run postinstall` to redownload the typedefinitions.
